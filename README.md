# Eye-Exercise
This project features eyes that follow cursor movements across the screen. They are an adorable and fun animation that can be used in many places. 

How to run: download files into a folder and open Index.html in your broweser.

Later on, I would like to add random blinking, as well as different styles of eyes (monster, Manga, cute, etc.).

As mentioned in the repository label, the license is MIT.
